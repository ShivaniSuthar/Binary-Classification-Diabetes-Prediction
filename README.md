## Project Summary:

In this project, my team and I used a medical data set from Kaggle in order to build a model to predict diabetes in patients. More specifically, we trained KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logsitic Classifier, and SVM models and compared them using metrics such as weighted recall, false negative rate, and AUC curves.

This project was completed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook primarily using skleanrn, NumPy, and Pandas
